# Leave-Management-Sysytem
>The Leave Management System Project in Python is design using tkinter and graphical user interface(GUI). SQLIte3 database is used in our project. This project is totally build on admin side means only admin got the access for managing it. It manages all the information about the employee and leave type. Employee can apply for leaves and see if they are approved by Admin. 
  - The Username and password for admin is same i.e., "admin"
  - The Employee ID and Password is also same for example if Employee ID is "1" then password would also be "1".
  - The database used in this project is SQLite3.
  - I have used functional approach to build this project.
